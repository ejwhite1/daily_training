I watched a bit more of section 4 of the JS and AJAX series.
I want to try the progressive search with the jargon file data
tomorrow.

Reviewed the first part of section 4 of the JS and AJAX series
and tweaked the jargon file script to read from the a.json file
and display the 'entry' value in index.html.

Also searched for some tools to try to convert the jargon file
HTML to JSON. Both Parsely (https://github.com/buckyroberts/Parsley)
and the scrape tool (listed on this data science page: 
http://jeroenjanssens.com/2013/09/19/seven-command-line-tools-for-data-science.html)
could be helpful.

Watched the first part of section 4 of JS and AJAX again and
tried to read in the a.json file using the code from the video.
It failed at first but after getting my JSON file formatted
correctly it worked.

I had to run XAMPP to get the data file loaded. Otherwise the 
browser won't let Javascript open files directly on disk. 

I was working in C:\xampp\htdocs\daily after copying files over from
C:\Users\ejwhite1\Documents\daily_training\Training_log\ExerciseFiles\04-01.

Tomorrow I hope to watch the rest of the Lynda.com vides and 
get the Chrome debugging working with VS Code.

Watched most of section 4 of JS and AJAX and started writing JSON file
as a test for the jargon file.

Watched section 3 of JS and AJAX at home and spent some time thinking 
about how to update the New Hacker's Dictionary.

I ran out of time to do the section 1 exercises at work but I did watch
section 2 of JS and AJAX at home at night.

2017-01-05

Finished section 1. Getting Started in the JS and AJAX Lynda.com video. I watched
this at home at night. Try the section 1 exercises at work tomorrow.

2017-01-04

Watched some of JavaScript and AJAX on Lynda.com. I want to review the robot
code to see how this is done there.

Today I uninstalled GitHub for Windows from my PC and installed Git for Windows. 

Github for Windows was failing to sync to the remote server. Since the Lynda.com
videos I was watching were referring to Git for Windows and not Github for 
Windows I thought I should be in sync. 

I finished watching the Javascript Functions course.

I also watched some of the Git Essential Training via Lynda after watching 
the shorter intro Lynda Git course.

I also cloned my Github repo of Eloquent_Javascript down to 
C:\Users\ejwhite1\Documents\daily_training.
