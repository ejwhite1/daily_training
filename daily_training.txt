Today I uninstalled GitHub for Windows from my PC and installed Git for Windows. 

Github for Windows was failing to sync to the remote server. Since the Lynda.com
videos I was watching were referring to Git for Windows and not Github for 
Windows I thought I should be in sync. 

I also watched some of the Git Essential Training via Lynda after watching 
the shorter intro Lynda Git course.
