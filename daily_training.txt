I ran out of time to do the section 1 exercises at work but I did watch
section 2 of JS and AJAX at home at night.

Finished section 1. Getting Started in the JS and AJAX Lynda.com video. I watched
this at home at night. Try the section 1 exercises at work tomorrow.

Watched some of JavaScript and AJAX on Lynda.com. I want to review the robot
code to see how this is done there.

Today I uninstalled GitHub for Windows from my PC and installed Git for Windows. 

Github for Windows was failing to sync to the remote server. Since the Lynda.com
videos I was watching were referring to Git for Windows and not Github for 
Windows I thought I should be in sync. 

I finished watching the Javascript Functions course.

I also watched some of the Git Essential Training via Lynda after watching 
the shorter intro Lynda Git course.

I also cloned my Github repo of Eloquent_Javascript down to 
C:\Users\ejwhite1\Documents\daily_training.
